<p>“Darkness” refers to a lack of pre-trade quote transparency - neither the buyer nor the seller posts a visible bid or ask (Hasbrouck, 2017). Dark pools are alternative trading systems in which dark trades of securities and other financial instruments take place; these marketplaces are frequently used by large block traders (such as exchanges and institutional investors) who wish to trade without revealing information pre-trade that may cause markets to move against them (Aguilar 2015). Dark markets function in contrast to ‘lit’ markets; in lit markets, pre-trade bid and ask quotes are publicly displayed. Examples of lit markets include national exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, and other traditional pools of liquidity.</p>
