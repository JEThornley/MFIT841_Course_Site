<p>A ‘speed bump’ is a mechanism for slowing down fast traders in order to give slower traders a fairer chance at the market. By implementing a timed delay (usually milliseconds) between the receipt of an order and the execution of its instructions, speed bumps are intended to mitigate the effects of asymmetric information by reducing the speed advantage of fast, sophisticated traders - such as predatory high-frequency traders (IIROC,  2018). However, critics of the mechanism (including many electronic trading firms) attest that speed bumps may make markets unnecessarily complex and unfairly favor certain market participants (Osipovich, 2019). Despite these concerns, nearly a dozen exchanges have proposed or implemented speed bumps. While the design of speed bumps differs across exchanges, all speed bumps in operation (except for IEX, which employs a “symmetrical” speed bump across all but pegged orders) are random and asymmetric, meaning that only liquidity-taking order types are delayed (Aoyagi, 2020).</p>

<p>While some exchanges have readily adopted speed bumps and other speed-control measures, the question remains - are slower markets better? As you read through the following articles, consider whether you feel that exchanges should have a role in controlling the speed of their trading participants.</p>
