High-frequency traders use powerful computing technology to quickly process a high number of trades, often applying complex algorithms to trade across several markets simultaneously. In 2010, the SEC identified five characteristics that are frequently associated with high-frequency trading:
1. Use of extraordinarily high speed and sophisticated programs for generating, routing, and executing orders.
1. Use of co-location services and individual data feeds offered by exchanges and others to minimize network and other latencies.
1. Very short time-frames for establishing and liquidating positions.
1. Submission of numerous orders that are cancelled shortly after submission.
1. Ending the trading day in as close to a flat position as possible (that is, not carrying significant, unhedged positions overnight).” [(SEC, 2014, pg. 4)](https://www.sec.gov/marketstructure/research/hft_lit_review_march_2014.pdf)
 
High-frequency trading made notable headlines in 2010 when it was suspected to have been the driver of a “flash crash” that occurred on May 6, 2010; during the crash, a number of stock indices including the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average collapsed and rebounded within the span of 36 minutes. Within the 2010 Concept Release, the SEC acknowledged that HFT was one of the most significant market structure developments of the period, and that “[b]y any measure, HFT is a dominant component of the current market structure and likely to affect nearly all aspects of its performance.” [(SEC, 2010, pg. 3606)]((https://www.sec.gov/rules/concept/2010/34-61358fr.pdf))
